/*For this challenge you will actually have to watch the video! Then, build the image
loading functionality that I just showed you on the screen.
Your tasks:
Tasks are not super-descriptive this time, so that you can figure out some stuff by
yourself. Pretend you're working on your own �
PART 1
1. Create a function 'createImage' which receives 'imgPath' as an input.
This function returns a promise which creates a new image (use
document.createElement('img')) and sets the .src attribute to the
provided image path
2. When the image is done loading, append it to the DOM element with the
'images' class, and resolve the promise. The fulfilled value should be the
image element itself. In case there is an error loading the image (listen for
the'error' event), reject the promise
3. If this part is too tricky for you, just watch the first part of the solution */

function createImage(imgPath){
    const img = document.createElement('img')
    img.setAttribute('src',imgPath)
    document.body.appendChild(img)
}
const imgLink = './dice_img.jpg'
createImage(imgLink)
